## Overview
A web application as I wanted to play with the [Sentiment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sentiment) npm module. 
I also wanted to get this working client side only, so I had to learn [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).

I also had the chance to play around with making some okay looking animations for the results of the sentiment analysis.

Of course, I had to learn and use the Reddit API to make this project work.
